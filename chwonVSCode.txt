let's say I have a directory called project1 in my /var/opt location and my user name is mir

cd /var/opt

sudo chown mir project1

However, if you already created some file before applying chown, don't forget to change their permission also

sudo chown your_username your_project_directory/your_file_name

Example

sudo chown mir project1/file1.txt

It's recommended because it neither creates any security issue nor gives unnecessary access to your projects to the others. It solves your problem by keeping your's project up to you. Because using the chown command you have limited the full access of your project directory within your user account.
