Installing .run Packages
Warning
Careful consideration must be put into place whenever installing anything outside of the official repositories. Run files install software into the system via a script rather than a package manager. Verify that the run file you obtained came from a source that you trust before executing it.

Installation
Follow the procedures below to install software packaged in a .run file:

GUI
Find the .run file in the File Browser.

Right-click the file and select Properties.

Under the Permissions tab, make sure that Allow executing file as program is ticked and press Close.

Double-click the .run file to open it. A dialog box should appear.
Press Run in Terminal to run the installer.

A Terminal window will open. Follow any instructions on-screen to install the program.

Command-Line
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
Execute chmod +x <file-to-give-execute-permission>.run

Now that the execute permission has been set, simply run ./<file>.run
